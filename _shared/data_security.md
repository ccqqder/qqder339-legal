# Data Security

## Security Measures

### Local Storage Only
- All user data is stored exclusively on your device
- No external servers or cloud storage
- Data remains under your complete control

### No Third-Party Services
Our apps do **NOT** use:
- ❌ Google Analytics
- ❌ Facebook SDK
- ❌ Firebase Analytics
- ❌ Advertising frameworks
- ❌ Crash reporting services
- ❌ Any third-party tracking SDKs

### Data Isolation
- **App Sandbox:** All data is isolated within the app's sandbox container
- **App Groups:** Some data may be shared with widgets/extensions via iOS App Groups (local only)
- **No Cross-App Tracking:** No data sharing with other apps or services

### User Data Control
You maintain complete control over your data:
- **Delete App = Delete Data:** Uninstalling the app removes all stored data
- **No Account Required:** No login, no account creation, no password storage
- **No Data Recovery:** We cannot recover your data because we never have access to it

### iOS Security
Your data benefits from iOS built-in security:
- Device encryption (when enabled)
- Secure storage APIs
- iOS permission system
